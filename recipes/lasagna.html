    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is sure to impress. Lasagna is a classic dish from Italy, and
        for good reason. It's easy to make, and it's a crowd pleaser. It can be served warm or cold, and each ingredient
        has been sourced from local, or even international, farms.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato
            paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian
            seasoning,
            fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
